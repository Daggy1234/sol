API Reference
===============

The following pages describe the C++ API used for Sol. Everything in Sol resides in the ``sol`` namespace.
There are a few nested namespaces such as ``sol::stack`` that are also documented. If you want to include
the entire library, you could do that by doing::

    #include <sol.hpp>

Every page in the documentation specifies what file you could include to get the functionality. These includes assume that
the directory structure is the same as the one done by cloning the repository.
